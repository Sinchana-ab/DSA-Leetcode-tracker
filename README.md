# DSA-LeetCode-Java

Welcome to my Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) journey!  
This repository contains Java solutions for LeetCode and other DSA problems I'm solving daily to improve my coding skills and prepare for technical interviews.

## ðŸ§  Goals
- Strengthen problem-solving skills
- Learn DSA concepts through practice
- Maintain consistency with daily/weekly challenges

## ðŸ“š Topics Covered
- Arrays
- Strings
- Searching & Sorting
- Recursion
- Dynamic Programming (upcoming)
- Trees, Graphs, and more (coming soon)

## âœ… Problems Solved (So Far)
